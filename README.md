# Dotfiles Install

```
git clone https://github.com/AhmetinzmSec/Hyprland-DotFiles-v2.5.git
```

```cd Hyprland-DotFiles-v2.5```

Run the install file (Beta): `./Install.sh`

or install it manually:


Let's start with a backup. To receive using a terminal:

```
cp -r ~/.config ~/.config.bak
cp -r ~/.icons ~/.icons.bak
cp -r ~/.fonts ~/.fonts.bak
cp -r ~/.themes ~/.themes.bak
cp -r ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.bak
cp -r ~/.aliases ~/.aliases.bak
```

Or take a manual backup:


- Don't lose your configuration:

Go to the `/home/user/` directory and copy the `.config` folder and paste it without leaving the same directory. Change the name of the pasted folder to `.config.bak`


- Don't lose your icons:

Go to the `/home/user/` directory and copy the `.icons` folder and paste it without leaving the same directory. Change the name of the pasted folder to `.icons.bak`


- Don't lose your fonts:

Go to the `/home/user/` directory and copy the `.fonts` folder and paste it without leaving the same directory. Change the name of the pasted folder to `.fonts.bak`


- Don't lose your themes:

Go to the `/home/user/` directory and copy the `.themes` folder and paste it without leaving the same directory. Change the name of the pasted folder to `.themes.bak`


Now let's back up our files:


- Don't lose your ZSH configuration:

Go to the `/home/user/` directory and copy and paste the `.zshrc` file without leaving the same directory. Change the name of the pasted file to `.zshrc.bak`


- Aliases are a file specially prepared for me. Most likely you do not have this file. If so, follow this step:

Go to the `/home/user/` directory and copy and paste the `.aliases` file without leaving the same directory. Change the name of the pasted file to `.aliases.bak`


Pay attention to the file and folder names I wrote. If the name of your configuration files is not currently written, you do not have any previous configuration. You don't need to make backups for these.

For example, I have a file named `.aliases`. This file does not have to be available to everyone. You don't need to force a backup for this.
